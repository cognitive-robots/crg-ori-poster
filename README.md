# Cognitive Robotics Group ORI Poster
A [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) [beamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)) poster style themed for the [Cognitive Robotics Group, Oxford Robotics Institute](https://www.ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/cognitive-robotics-group/). 

Based upon an [earlier LaTeX poster style](https://github.com/gbaydin/oxford-poster) for the University of Oxford by Atılım Güneş Baydin (<gunes@robots.ox.ac.uk>), which itself is based off the [latex-beamerposter](https://github.com/deselaers/latex-beamerposter) package by Philippe Dreuw and Thomas Deselaers.

Template is A0 size and portrait by default. If template size is changed figure sizes will likely need changing in the style in order to better fit the new scale.
